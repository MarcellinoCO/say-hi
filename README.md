# 👋 Say Hi!

A real time simple chat app created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) based on the video by [Fireship.io](https://youtu.be/zQyrwxMPm88).


## 👨‍💻 Technology Stack
This project experiments with the following technologies:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org),
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) (Authentication + Firestore),
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

New things I've learnt with this project:
* How to make a chat app (like yoo who else have ever done that? 😎),
* Types in Typescript (it still confuses me tho),
* The JavaScript array functions (especially reduce),
* More React hooks (so much more than useState and useEffect).


## 🌐 Deployed App
A fully functional instance for this project is available on [say-hi-rose.vercel.app](https://say-hi-rose.vercel.app).
